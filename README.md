# Sudoku Solver
A program to solve a user-inputted sudoku puzzle using backtracking.
To use, simply run GUI.py and type the starting numbers for your puzzle into the boxes. Then click solve to see the solution.

## Text-Based Version
Also included is the file all_solutions_finder.py. If you are unsure of whether your sudoku puzzle has any valid solutions or if it may have multiple solutions, just type it out in the grid arrays called *board* and run the script. The output will be the solutions to the puzzle (if any) and a count of the number of solutions.
